> [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

### Elevator pitch

This app allows you to track and share personal scoreboards and individuals stats optionally. This works great for sharing games and players stats as well as tracking them over extended periods of time. This allows you to save important information for the teams, and the players in an easy manner. Allowing the stat keepers to save this information and focus on whats really important, the game. 

### Design

![Design image](Homepage)

Another page for tracking score and players stats, need to add a way to search games based off of usernames or assigning game id's etc.
